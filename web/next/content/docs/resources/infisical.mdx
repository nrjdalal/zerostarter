## CLI Reference

### Installation

```sh
bun add -g @infisical/cli
```

### Login

Login into Infisical from the CLI

- Interactive

```sh
infisical login
```

- Non-interactive
  - `--plain`: When used with direct user login or machine identity authentication, outputs only the JWT access token without any additional formatting. This is useful for scripting and CI/CD pipelines where you need to capture the token.
  - `--silent`: Use it alongside the `--plain` flag to disable all messages in the console except from the access token.

```sh
infisical login \
  --domain "<YOUR_DOMAIN>" \
  --email "<YOUR_EMAIL>" \
  --password "<YOUR_PASSWORD>" \
  --organization-id "<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID>" \
  --plain \
  --silent
```

### Init

Switch between Infisical projects within CLI

```sh
infisical init
```

Link a local project to your Infisical project. Once connected, you can then access the secrets locally from the connected Infisical project.

> This command creates a `.infisical.json` file containing your Project ID.

### Export

Export Infisical secrets from CLI into different file formats

```sh
infisical export --env=dev --output-file=./.env.development
```

- `--env`: The environment to export secrets for, defaults to `dev`. Can be one of: `dev`, `staging`, `prod`.
- `--projectId`: By default the project id is retrieved from the `.infisical.json` located at the root of your local project. This flag allows you to override this behavior by explicitly defining the project to fetch your secrets from.
