## Overview

ZeroStarter includes optional integration for collecting user feedback. When configured, feedback links appear in two locations:

1. **Docs Sidebar Footer**: A feedback link appears in the docs sidebar footer
2. **Dashboard User Menu**: A feedback option appears in the user dropdown menu in the dashboard sidebar

Both locations allow users to submit feedback and only appear when the feedback URL is configured.

## Setup

### 1. Configure Environment Variable

Add your feedback URL to your `.env` file:

```
# Optional: Manage user feedback `https://zerostarter.dev/docs/manage/feedback`
NEXT_PUBLIC_USERJOT_URL=
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

The feedback URL is configured in `packages/env/src/web-next.ts`:

```ts
client: {
  NEXT_PUBLIC_USERJOT_URL: z.url().optional(),
}
```

The feedback links will automatically appear in both locations when `NEXT_PUBLIC_USERJOT_URL` is set. If the variable is not set or is empty, the links will not be displayed.

## Features

- **Docs Sidebar Footer**: Feedback link appears in the docs sidebar footer
- **Dashboard User Menu**: Feedback option appears in the user dropdown menu (between user info and logout)
- **Optional**: Only loads when `NEXT_PUBLIC_USERJOT_URL` is configured
- **External Link**: Opens feedback URL in a new tab

## Disabling Feedback

To disable the feedback links, simply remove or leave empty the `NEXT_PUBLIC_USERJOT_URL` environment variable. The links will not be rendered in either location, ensuring zero performance impact when not in use.
