## Overview

ZeroStarter uses an automated release workflow that manages versioning, changelog generation, and GitHub releases. The workflow operates with `canary` (development) and `main` (production) branches, automatically creating draft PRs for review.

## Prerequisites

1. Enable the following GitHub setting for the workflow to function:

   **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**
   - ✅ **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**

   This setting is required for the automated workflows to create draft PRs.

2. **Changelog Configuration**: Manage `changelog.config.ts` to configure changelog generation:
   - `repo`: Your GitHub repository URL
   - `hideAuthorEmail`: Set to `true` to hide author emails in changelog

   ```ts
   // changelog.config.ts

   export default {
     repo: "https://github.com/nrjdalal/zerostarter",
   }
   ```

## Workflow

This project uses an automated release workflow with `canary` (development) and `main` (production) branches. All PRs are created as drafts for manual review.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Development Branch (canary)

Push changes to `canary` triggers `auto-canary-into-main.yml` workflow.

**Auto-creates draft PR:**

- Title: `ci(release): 🚀 merge canary into main`
- Head: `canary` → Base: `main`

</Step>

<Step>

### Production Branch (main)

Manually review and merge the draft PR from `canary` → `main`.

After merge, `auto-release.yml` workflow triggers automatically.

</Step>

<Step>

### Update Changelog Branch

Workflow creates/updates `changelog` branch from `main`:

- Generates `CHANGELOG.md` using `changelogen --bump`
- Bumps version in `package.json`
- Commits: `ci(changelog): update changelog and bump version`

</Step>

<Step>

### Changelog PR to Canary

If changes detected, auto-creates draft PR:

- Title: `ci(changelog): 📖 update changelog and bump version`
- Head: `changelog` → Base: `canary`

</Step>

<Step>

### Back to Development

Manually review and merge the changelog PR to sync version and changelog back to `canary`.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Build Checks

`auto-check-build.yml` runs on pushes to `canary` and PR updates, executing lint, build, and type checks.

## GitHub Releases

`changelogen` generates `CHANGELOG.md` with categorized changes, commit links, and contributors. When creating a GitHub release:

1. **Go to Releases**: Navigate to your repository's Releases page and click "Draft a new release"
2. **Create Tag**: Create a new tag matching the version in `package.json` (e.g., `v0.0.7`)
3. **Copy from CHANGELOG.md**: Copy the changelog entry for that version from `CHANGELOG.md` and paste it as the release notes

   The changelog entry includes:
   - Version header with compare changes link
   - Categorized changes (📖 Documentation, 🏡 Chore, etc.)
   - Commit links with hashes
   - Contributor credits

**Note**: Don't use GitHub's "Generate release notes" feature. The `CHANGELOG.md` generated by `changelogen` already contains the properly formatted release notes based on conventional commits.
